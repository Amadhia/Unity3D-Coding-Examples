# Unity3D-Coding-Examples
This repository includes sample projects made with Unity, with the purpose of creating reusable, manageable pieces of code that can be used as toolsets on larger-scale applications. 
## 1. Procedural Water Surface
demo-video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy8MhL6WoSw
more info about this example: http://www.konsfik.com/procedural-water-surface-made-in-unity3d/
The first sample-project is a code - generated water surface, made entirely (from scratch) in Unity by the use of c# prorgamming. The source-code is heavily commented so that someone may easily follow through the process inorder to learn or inorder to further-develop the example.

## 2. Procedural Landscape
Coming soon!
