# Unity3D-Coding-Examples
This repository includes sample projects made with Unity, with the purpose of creating a collection of reusable, manageable pieces of code that can be used as toolsets on larger-scale applications.  
## 1. Procedural Water Surface
project - specific - folder: https://github.com/konsfik/Unity3D-Coding-Examples/tree/master/1-Procedural-Water-Surface  
### 1.1. Description:
This project is a case study on **"how you can procedurally generate Waves on a Custom Mesh-Surface by using C# code in Unity3D"**. Keep in mind that this is **not** a fluid-simulation, but rather a mathematical approximation of how a fluid-surface might "look like". Meaning that there is not an underlying physical model that drives the simulation, but only some mathematical functions (sinusoidal) that shape the surface's form.

## 2. Procedural Landscape  
project - specific - folder: https://github.com/konsfik/Unity3D-Coding-Examples/tree/master/2-Procedural-Landscape  
### 2.1. Description:  
This project is a case-study on **"how you can procedurally generate a landscape - surface in Unity, using c# code"**. It allows you to make changes and see a preview of the generated mesh in Unity editor's edit-mode.  
The aim is to also be able to save the generated mesh as a prefab, but I have not implemented this functionality yet. More details coming soon.
