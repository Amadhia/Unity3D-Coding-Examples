# Unity3D-Coding-Examples
This repository includes sample projects made with Unity, with the purpose of creating reusable, manageable pieces of code that can be used as toolsets on larger-scale applications. 
## 1. Procedural Water Surface
The first sample-project is a code - generated water surface, made entirely (from scratch) in Unity by the use of c# prorgamming. The source-code is heavily commented so that someone may easily follow through the process inorder to learn or inorder to further-develop the example.

## 2. Procedural Landscape
This is a case-study on "how you can procedurally create a landscape - surface in Unity, using c# code". The project allows you to make changes and see a preview of the generated mesh in edit-mode as well. The aim is to also be able to save the generated mesh as a prefab, but I have not implemented this functionality yet. More details coming soon.
